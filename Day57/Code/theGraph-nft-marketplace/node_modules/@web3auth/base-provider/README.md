> Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.

Each adapter in Web3Auth exposes a Provider on successful user authentication. This provider can be used to interact with wallet or connected chain using RPC calls. This base provider is the base implementation of a JRPC provider, and is the foundation of all other providers.
