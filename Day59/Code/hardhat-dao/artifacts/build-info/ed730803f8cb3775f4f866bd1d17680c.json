We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always. Can be combined with {SafeMath} and {SignedSafeMath} to extend it to smaller types, by performing all math on `uint256` and `int256` and then downcasting.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol\":\"SafeCast\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x02686c31ccb9ee77a299fa5f47327af5271f251a707a0e24f321957166ff0434\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://cb562d8ae1da31249ca0d8553df9f89ef4c3c110a018c4449dde68ae30e51ec1\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmUwxjtTUYB89ymeV46TZPmTsGnYrKNcgTHk7MQA1MG3hj\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"contracts/GovernanceToken.sol":{"GovernanceToken":{"abi":[{"inputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"owner","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"spender","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"value","type":"uint256"}],"name":"Approval","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"delegator","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"fromDelegate","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"toDelegate","type":"address"}],"name":"DelegateChanged","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"delegate","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"previousBalance","type":"uint256"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"newBalance","type":"uint256"}],"name":"DelegateVotesChanged","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"from","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"to","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"value","type":"uint256"}],"name":"Transfer","type":"event"},{"inputs":[],"name":"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR","outputs":[{"internalType":"bytes32","name":"","type":"bytes32"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"owner","type":"address"},{"internalType":"address","name":"spender","type":"address"}],"name":"allowance","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"spender","type":"address"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"approve","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"account","type":"address"}],"name":"balanceOf","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"account","type":"address"},{"internalType":"uint32","name":"pos","type":"uint32"}],"name":"checkpoints","outputs":[{"components":[{"internalType":"uint32","name":"fromBlock","type":"uint32"},{"internalType":"uint224","name":"votes","type":"uint224"}],"internalType":"struct
